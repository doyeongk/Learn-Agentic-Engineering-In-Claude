# Tutorial: Your First Repository

> **What you will build**: A "learning-journal" repository on GitHub with multiple files and a visible commit history.
>
> **Prerequisites**: A GitHub account (free). If you do not have one, create one at [github.com](https://github.com).
>
> **Time**: ~25 minutes

## Introduction

We are going to create your first repository — a place on GitHub where your files live, tracked and versioned. Think of it as a project folder with superpowers: every change you make is recorded, and you can always go back in time.

We will do everything through GitHub's web interface. No installation, no command line. By the end, you will have a real repository with multiple files and a history of changes you can explore.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.

Fill in the details:

- **Repository name**: `learning-journal`
- **Description**: `My learning journal for tracking progress`
- **Visibility**: Public (so you can share it later if you want)
- **Initialise this repository with**: Tick the box for **Add a README file**

Click **Create repository**.

You now have a repository. GitHub has created it with a single file (`README.md`) and a single commit. The commit message will say something like "Initial commit" — this is Git recording the moment the repository was born.

## Step 2: Edit the README

Click on the `README.md` file to open it, then click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top-right of the file view.

Replace the contents with:

```markdown title="README.md"
# Learning Journal

This is where I track what I learn each day.

## About

I'm learning about GitHub, Claude Code, and context engineering.
Started: February 2026.
```

Scroll down to the **Commit changes** section. You will see a text field for a commit message. Write:

```
Update README with journal description
```

Leave "Commit directly to the main branch" selected and click **Commit changes**.

You have just made your second commit. GitHub recorded exactly what changed: the old content of README.md and the new content, plus your message explaining why.

## Step 3: Create a New File

Click the **Add file** button near the top of your repository page and select **Create new file**.

In the filename field, type `day-1.md`. In the file content area, write:

```markdown title="day-1.md"
# Day 1: What is GitHub?

## What I Learned

- GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects
- Git tracks changes over time like an infinite undo history
- A repository is a project folder with version tracking
- Every change is recorded as a "commit"

## Questions I Have

- What happens when two people change the same file?
- How do branches work?

## One Thing That Surprised Me

You don't need to be a programmer to use GitHub.
```

Write the commit message:

```
Add day 1 learning journal entry
```

Click **Commit new file**.

Your repository now has two files and three commits. Each commit is a snapshot of the project at that moment.

## Step 4: Explore the Commit History

Click on the **commits** link near the top of your repository page (it might show as "3 commits" with a clock icon).

You will see a list of every commit, newest first:

1. **Add day 1 learning journal entry** — your most recent change
2. **Update README with journal description** — your edit to the README
3. **Initial commit** — when the repository was created

Click on the "Update README with journal description" commit. GitHub shows you a **diff** — a side-by-side comparison of what the file looked like before and after. Lines in red were removed. Lines in green were added.

This is the power of version control. Every change is recorded, comparable, and reversible.

## Step 5: Make Another Edit to See Versions

Go back to your repository's main page (click the repository name at the top). Open `day-1.md` and click the pencil icon to edit.

Add a new section at the bottom:

```markdown
## Updated Thoughts

After exploring the commit history, I can see exactly what changed
and when. Each commit is like a bookmark in time.
```

Commit with the message:

```
Add reflections to day 1 entry
```

Now click on `day-1.md` again to view it. Click the **History** button (clock icon) to see every version of just this file. You can click on each commit to see how the file changed at that point.

## What We Built

You created a real GitHub repository with:

- **Two files**: `README.md` and `day-1.md`
- **Four commits**: each recording a specific change with a message
- **A visible history**: you can trace every change, see diffs, and understand the evolution of your project

This is the foundation of everything that follows. Repositories are where projects live. Commits are how changes are tracked. The history is your safety net — nothing is ever truly lost.

## Knowledge Check

1. What does a commit represent in Git?
   - A) A snapshot of the entire project at a specific moment, with a description
   - B) A saved file
   - C) A backup copy of the repository
   - D) A message to other collaborators

2. In your own words, explain why commit messages matter. What would happen if you just used "update" for every commit?
