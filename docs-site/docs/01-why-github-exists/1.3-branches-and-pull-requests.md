# Tutorial: Branches and Pull Requests

> **What you will build**: A new `goals.md` file in your learning-journal, proposed through a branch and merged via a pull request.
>
> **Prerequisites**: A GitHub account and the `learning-journal` repository from Module 1.2.
>
> **Time**: ~25 minutes

## Introduction

So far, every change we have made went straight into the main version of our project. That works fine when you are the only person editing, but it falls apart the moment someone else is involved — or the moment you want to try something without risking what already works.

Branches solve this. A branch is a parallel copy of your project where you can make changes without touching the original. When you are happy with your changes, you open a **pull request** (PR) — a formal proposal that says "here is what I changed, please review it and merge it in." This is how virtually all collaboration happens on GitHub.

We are going to add a goals file to our learning journal using this workflow.

## Step 1: Create a Branch

Open your `learning-journal` repository on GitHub. Near the top-left of the page, you will see a dropdown that says **main**. This is the branch selector.

Click the dropdown. In the text field, type `add-goals` and then click **Create branch: add-goals from main**.

GitHub creates a new branch instantly. Notice the dropdown now shows **add-goals** instead of **main**. You are now working on a parallel copy. Any changes we make here will not affect the `main` branch until we explicitly merge them.

:::tip
Branch names should be short and descriptive. Use hyphens between words. Good: `add-goals`, `fix-typo`, `update-readme`. Bad: `my-branch`, `test`, `branch1`.
:::

## Step 2: Create `goals.md` on the Branch

Make sure the branch selector still shows **add-goals**. Click **Add file** and select **Create new file**.

In the filename field, type `goals.md`. Add the following content:

```markdown title="goals.md"
# Learning Goals

## Short-term (this week)

- Understand what repositories, commits, and branches are
- Create and merge a pull request
- Set up Claude Desktop for daily use

## Medium-term (this month)

- Be comfortable navigating GitHub repositories
- Use Claude Code for a real task
- Write a basic CLAUDE.md file

## Long-term

- Build context engineering into my workflow
- Contribute to an open-source project
- Use AI tools confidently and critically
```

Write the commit message:

```
Add learning goals
```

Make sure "Commit directly to the `add-goals` branch" is selected. Click **Commit new file**.

The file now exists on the `add-goals` branch — but if you switch back to **main** using the branch dropdown, you will not see it there. The two branches have diverged.

## Step 3: Open a Pull Request

After committing, GitHub often shows a yellow banner at the top of the repository page saying **add-goals had recent pushes** with a **Compare & pull request** button. Click it.

If you do not see the banner, click the **Pull requests** tab at the top of the repository, then click **New pull request**. Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `add-goals`.

You will see the pull request form. Fill it in:

- **Title**: `Add learning goals`
- **Description**: `Adds a goals.md file with short-term, medium-term, and long-term learning goals.`

Click **Create pull request**.

## Step 4: Review the Diff

You are now on the pull request page. Click the **Files changed** tab. GitHub shows you a diff — the exact changes this branch introduces compared to `main`.

You will see the entire `goals.md` file highlighted in green, because every line is new. In a real collaboration scenario, a teammate would review this diff, leave comments, and either approve or request changes.

Notice the summary at the top: **1 file changed** with the number of additions. This gives reviewers a quick sense of scope.

:::note
Pull requests are not just a merge mechanism. They are a communication tool. The description explains *why* the change exists. The diff shows *what* changed. Comments let people discuss *how* to improve it. This is why PRs are central to professional workflows.

## Step 5: Merge the Pull Request

Click back to the **Conversation** tab of the pull request. At the bottom, you will see a green **Merge pull request** button.

Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge**.

GitHub merges the changes from `add-goals` into `main`. You will see a message confirming the merge. GitHub may also offer to **Delete branch** — click it, since the branch has served its purpose and keeping it around adds clutter.

## Step 6: Verify and Explore the Network Graph

Go back to your repository's main page. You should now see `goals.md` listed alongside your other files. The branch's changes are now part of `main`.

To visualise what happened, click on **Insights** in the repository's top navigation, then select **Network** from the sidebar. The network graph shows your branches and merges as a timeline. You will see where `add-goals` diverged from `main` and where it merged back in.

If you click the **commits** link from the main repository page, you will see the merge commit alongside your earlier commits. The full history is preserved — Git knows this change came through a branch and a pull request.

## What We Built

We completed a full branch-and-merge workflow:

- **Created a branch** (`add-goals`) to isolate our changes from `main`
- **Added a file** (`goals.md`) on that branch without affecting the main version
- **Opened a pull request** to formally propose the change
- **Reviewed the diff** to see exactly what was being added
- **Merged** the pull request to bring the changes into `main`
- **Explored the network graph** to visualise the branch and merge

This is the same workflow used by teams of two or two thousand. Every feature, every fix, every experiment starts as a branch and arrives through a pull request. The process creates a clear record of what changed, why, and who approved it.

## Knowledge Check

1. What is the primary purpose of creating a branch?
   - A) To back up your repository
   - B) To share your repository with others
   - C) To delete files safely
   - D) To make changes in isolation without affecting the main version

2. In your own words, explain why a team would use pull requests instead of committing directly to the main branch. What could go wrong without them?
