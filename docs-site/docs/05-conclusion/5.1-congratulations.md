# That's the curriculum.

You went from version control basics to running parallel AI agents. Not bad.

The system that taught you this is the same system it was teaching you about. The CLAUDE.md, the skills, the subagents running during `/init` — all of it was real.

If you want to use this setup to learn something else, clone [Learn Anything In Claude](https://github.com/doyeongk/Learn-Anything-In-Claude), run `/init`, and describe what you want to learn. It'll build you a curriculum for any topic.
