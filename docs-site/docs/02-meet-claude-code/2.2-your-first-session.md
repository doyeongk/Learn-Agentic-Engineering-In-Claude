# Tutorial: Your First Claude Code Session

> **What you will build**: Familiarity with Claude Code by exploring the project you are learning from — a meta experience where the tool teaches you about itself.
>
> **Prerequisites**: A terminal application (Terminal on macOS, or any terminal emulator), Node.js 18+ installed, an Anthropic API key or Claude subscription.
>
> **Time**: ~25 minutes

## Introduction

The best way to understand an AI agent is to watch it work. In this tutorial, we will install Claude Code and immediately put it to use exploring the very project you are learning from right now. This is deliberately meta — you will ask Claude Code to explain the structure of the curriculum it is delivering to you.

By the end, you will have seen Claude Code read files, search a project, create a new file, and report back on its own behaviour. You will have a concrete, first-hand sense of what "agent" means in practice.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

We need to install Claude Code globally using npm. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This installs the `claude` command, which you can run from any directory.

:::tip
If you do not have `npm` installed, you will need Node.js first. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) — the LTS version is fine. After installing Node.js, `npm` will be available automatically.
:::

Verify the installation worked:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see a version number printed. If you get "command not found", the installation did not complete — check that your Node.js `bin` directory is in your system's `PATH`.

## Step 2: Launch Claude Code in This Project

Navigate to the root of this project in your terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/Learn-Agentic-Engineering-In-Claude
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual location where you cloned this repository.

Now launch Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

You will see a prompt where you can type natural language instructions. This is the agent interface — no special syntax, no programming language, just English.

Notice how different this feels from a chat window. You are inside your terminal, sitting in a real project directory. Claude Code can see everything you can see.

## Step 3: Ask Claude Code to Describe the Project

Type the following (or something like it — exact wording does not matter):

```text
Describe the structure of this project. What files and directories exist, and what is their purpose?
```

Watch what happens. Claude Code will:

1. Use its `Glob` tool to list files and directories
2. Use its `Read` tool to open key files like `CLAUDE.md` and `package.json`
3. Synthesise what it found into a coherent description

Notice: you did not paste any files into a chat window. The agent went and found the information itself. This is the fundamental difference from a chat AI — it explores rather than waiting for you to provide context.

## Step 4: The Meta Moment

Now for the most interesting part. Ask Claude Code:

```text
Read the CLAUDE.md file and tell me: what instructions does it follow when interacting with me?
```

This is meta-learning in action. Claude Code will read the very instructions that govern its own behaviour and explain them to you. You will see it describe the command system, the progress tracking, the skill files, and the conventions it follows.

Take a moment to appreciate what just happened. The AI read its own instruction manual and reported on it. In a chat paradigm, you would have had to open `CLAUDE.md` yourself, copy the contents, paste them in, and ask for a summary. Here, one sentence was enough.

## Step 5: Create Something

Let us see Claude Code write a file. Ask it:

```text
Create a file called notes.md in the Code/ directory with a heading "My Learning Notes" and today's date. Add a section called "First Impressions" with a placeholder for me to write in later.
```

Claude Code will:

1. Use its `Write` tool to create the file
2. Show you what it is about to write
3. Ask for your permission (since it is creating a new file)
4. Report back once the file is created

After you approve, check that the file exists:

```bash
cat Code/notes.md
```

You should see the file Claude Code created. This is the agent taking a real action in your filesystem — not just suggesting what you could do, but actually doing it.

## Step 6: Ask What Happened

For our final step, let us ask Claude Code to reflect on its own process:

```text
What tools did you use during our conversation, and what did each one do?
```

Claude Code will list the tools it invoked — likely `Glob`, `Read`, `Write`, and possibly `Grep`. This gives you a concrete inventory of the agent's capabilities, observed through use rather than described in abstract.

:::note
The specific tool names and descriptions will become important in Module 2.4, where we cover the full tools and permissions reference.

## What We Built

In this tutorial, we:

- **Installed Claude Code** and verified it works from the terminal
- **Explored a project** by asking natural language questions and watching the agent gather information independently
- **Experienced the meta moment** of an AI reading and explaining its own instructions
- **Created a file** and observed the permission-based workflow where Claude Code asks before writing
- **Inspected the agent's behaviour** by asking it which tools it used and why

The key takeaway: you gave instructions in plain English, and Claude Code translated them into concrete actions — reading files, searching directories, writing content. You did not need to know any terminal commands, file paths, or programming syntax. The agent figured out the mechanics; you provided the direction.

## Knowledge Check

1. When you asked Claude Code to describe the project structure, what did it do *before* answering?
   - A) It waited for you to paste the file contents
   - B) It searched the internet for the answer
   - C) It used tools to read files and explore the directory
   - D) It generated a random structure based on common patterns

2. In your own words, describe what made the "meta moment" (Step 4) different from doing the same thing in Claude Desktop.
