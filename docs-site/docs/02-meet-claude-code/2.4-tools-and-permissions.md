# Tools and Permissions Reference

> Complete reference for every tool Claude Code can use and the permission system that keeps you in control.

## Overview

Claude Code interacts with your computer through **tools** — specific capabilities for reading, writing, executing, and searching. The **permission system** controls when it must ask for your approval.

## Tools by Category

### File Operations

| Tool | Purpose | Reads | Writes | Example |
|------|---------|:-----:|:------:|---------|
| `Read` | Open and display file contents | Yes | No | Read a configuration file to understand project settings |
| `Write` | Create or overwrite a file | No | Yes | Create a new module file from scratch |
| `Edit` | Make targeted changes to an existing file | Yes | Yes | Replace a specific function or fix a typo |
| `Glob` | Find files matching a name pattern | Yes | No | Find all `*.md` files in a directory |
| `Grep` | Search file contents with regex | Yes | No | Find every file that mentions "knowledge check" |

`Edit` performs exact string replacement — more precise than rewriting an entire file with `Write`.

### Execution

| Tool | Purpose | Side Effects | Permission Required |
|------|---------|:------------:|:-------------------:|
| `Bash` | Run terminal commands | Yes | Yes (by default) |

`Bash` can run any command your terminal supports. Because commands can modify your system, permission is always required in default mode.

### Web

| Tool | Purpose | Network Access |
|------|---------|:--------------:|
| `WebSearch` | Search the internet and return results | Yes |
| `WebFetch` | Retrieve and process content from a URL | Yes |

`WebSearch` returns search results; `WebFetch` retrieves content from a specific URL.

### Orchestration

| Tool | Purpose | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| `Task` | Delegate work to a sub-agent | Break complex tasks into independent pieces that run in parallel |
| `TodoWrite` | Track multi-step task progress | Maintain a checklist during long operations with many steps |

`Task` creates a sub-agent for independent sub-tasks. `TodoWrite` maintains an internal checklist for tracking progress.

## Permission Modes

Claude Code has three permission modes that control how much autonomy the agent has.

| Mode | Behaviour | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Default** | Asks permission before writing files and running commands | Learning, unfamiliar projects, careful work |
| **Auto-accept** | Runs commands and writes files without asking | Trusted, repetitive tasks where speed matters |
| **Plan mode** | Analyses and plans but does not take any actions | Reviewing what the agent would do before letting it act |

### Default Mode

The out-of-the-box setting. Reads and searches happen automatically. Writes, edits, and commands require your approval. Recommended while learning — you see every action before it happens.

### Auto-accept Mode

Skips permission prompts for routine actions. Still pauses for particularly risky commands. Use when you trust the agent and want speed.

### Plan Mode

The agent analyses and plans but takes no actions. Useful for reviewing what it *would* do before letting it act.

## The Safety Model

Claude Code's safety model has three layers that work together to prevent unintended consequences.

### Permission Prompts

In default mode, every destructive action requires your approval. You see the tool, its arguments, and options to approve, deny, or approve all similar actions.

### Git Integration

Claude Code works inside Git repositories. Every change is tracked and reversible. The agent may check `git status` before starting work, or suggest committing first so you have a rollback point. This is why Section 1 covered Git — version control is your safety net.

### Checkpoints and Escape

For multi-step tasks, the agent pauses at natural checkpoints. Press `Esc` at any time to interrupt mid-action.

## Quick Reference: Tool Permissions

| Action | Default Mode | Auto-accept |
|--------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Read a file | Automatic | Automatic |
| Search files (`Glob`/`Grep`) | Automatic | Automatic |
| Write a new file | Asks | Automatic |
| Edit an existing file | Asks | Automatic |
| Run a terminal command | Asks | Automatic |
| Web search / fetch | Automatic | Automatic |
| Destructive command (delete, etc.) | Asks | Asks |

## Knowledge Check

1. Which tool would Claude Code use to find all files named `progress.json` in a project?
   - A) `Grep`
   - B) `Read`
   - C) `Glob`
   - D) `Bash`

2. What is the difference between default mode and auto-accept mode?
   - A) Auto-accept uses a different AI model
   - B) Default mode asks permission before writes and commands; auto-accept skips most prompts
   - C) Auto-accept mode cannot read files
   - D) Default mode is slower because it uses a weaker model

3. Why is Git integration important for Claude Code's safety model? Answer in one or two sentences.
