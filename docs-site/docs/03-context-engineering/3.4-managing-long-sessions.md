# How to Manage Long Sessions

> **Goal**: Keep Claude Code responsive and accurate throughout extended work sessions by managing context effectively.
>
> **Prerequisites**: Understanding of context and the attention budget from [Module 3.3](./3.3-signal-noise-and-the-attention-budget.md).

## Overview

As a Claude Code session continues, the context window fills with conversation history, tool results, and file contents. This gradual accumulation degrades performance — the model becomes less reliable at following instructions and more likely to lose track of earlier context. These techniques help you stay in the productive zone.

## Steps

### 1. Start Fresh Sessions for Unrelated Tasks

Do not use a single Claude Code session for everything. If you finish working on a bug fix and want to start on a new feature, exit and start a new session:

```bash
# End the current session
# Press Ctrl+C or type /exit

# Start fresh
claude
```

Each new session starts with a clean context window. CLAUDE.md is reloaded. The attention budget resets. This is the single most effective technique for maintaining quality.

### 2. Use `/compact` to Compress History

When a session is getting long but you want to continue (because the agent has built up useful context about the current task), use the `/compact` command:

```
/compact
```

This tells Claude Code to summarise the conversation so far, replacing verbose history with a condensed summary. The model retains the key information but frees up space in the context window.

Use `/compact` when:
- You have been working for 15+ minutes on a single task
- Claude Code starts repeating itself or forgetting earlier instructions
- The task has changed direction and earlier context is no longer relevant

### 3. Check Context Usage with `/context`

Use the `/context` command to see how much of the context window is currently in use:

```
/context
```

This shows you the percentage of the context window that is filled. If you are above 70-80%, performance may start to degrade. Consider using `/compact` or starting a fresh session.

### 4. Break Large Tasks into Smaller Sessions

Instead of asking Claude Code to "refactor the entire authentication system" in one session, break it into focused tasks:

- Session 1: "Analyse the current auth system and list what needs to change"
- Session 2: "Refactor the login flow" (start fresh with the plan from session 1)
- Session 3: "Refactor the signup flow"
- Session 4: "Update the tests"

Each session gets a clean context window focused on a specific piece of work. Use CLAUDE.md or notes files to carry information between sessions.

### 5. Use CLAUDE.md for Cross-Session Continuity

Information that needs to persist across sessions belongs in CLAUDE.md or a project file — not in conversation history. If you discover an important convention or decision during a session, add it to CLAUDE.md before ending:

```
Add to CLAUDE.md that we use camelCase for all variable names in this project.
```

Next session, Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md and knows the convention without you repeating it.

### 6. Handle Variations

**If Claude Code seems confused or contradicts itself:**
Use `/compact` first. If that does not help, start a fresh session. The conversation history may contain conflicting instructions from different points in the discussion.

**If a task is taking many iterations:**
Pause and describe the goal again clearly. Sometimes the model has accumulated so much context about failed attempts that restating the objective cuts through the noise.

**If you need to switch topics mid-session:**
Either start a fresh session (preferred) or explicitly say "I am done with the previous task. New task:" to signal the shift.

## Verification

After applying these techniques, you should notice:
- Claude Code follows CLAUDE.md instructions more consistently
- Responses are more focused and less repetitive
- The agent requires fewer corrections and retry attempts

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Claude Code repeats itself | Context rot — history is too long | Use `/compact` or start a fresh session |
| Agent ignores CLAUDE.md rules | Rules are buried under conversation history | Start a fresh session to re-elevate CLAUDE.md |
| Responses become slow | Context window near capacity | Use `/compact` or start fresh |
| Agent forgets task from 10 minutes ago | Information pushed out of effective attention | Restate the task or use `/compact` |
| "I already told you that" feeling | The model cannot recall earlier messages | Re-provide key info, or start fresh |

## Knowledge Check

1. When should you start a fresh Claude Code session instead of continuing?
   - A) Every 5 minutes
   - B) When switching to an unrelated task or when context rot is noticeable
   - C) Only when Claude Code crashes
   - D) Never — longer sessions are always better
