# Tutorial: The CLAUDE.md You're Already Using

> **What you will build**: A deep understanding of how CLAUDE.md works by examining this project's file, observing its effects, and creating your own.
>
> **Prerequisites**: [Your First Claude Code Session](../02-meet-claude-code/2.2-your-first-session.md) completed. Claude Code installed.
>
> **Time**: ~25 minutes

## Introduction

We are going to do something unusual: we are going to examine the machinery while it is running. The `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of this project has been shaping every interaction you have had with Claude Code in this curriculum. We are going to read it, understand its sections, test its effects, and then create your own version for a different project.

This is the most META module in the curriculum. You are learning about context engineering by examining the context that has been engineering your learning experience.

## Step 1: Read CLAUDE.md with Claude Code

Open a terminal, navigate to this project, and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd path/to/Learn-Agentic-Engineering-In-Claude
claude
```

Ask Claude Code to read and summarise the CLAUDE.md:

```
Read CLAUDE.md and walk me through each section. What does each part do, and how does it affect your behaviour?
```

Watch what Claude Code reports. It will describe sections like:

- **Project Overview** — what this project is
- **Architecture** — the directory structure and how files relate
- **How Commands Work** — the slash command system
- **How Skills Work** — the reference knowledge system
- **Progress Tracking** — how your state is stored
- **Key Conventions** — naming rules, formats, standards

Notice that Claude Code does not just read the file — it understands it. Because CLAUDE.md is in its context window, the instructions actively shape its responses.

## Step 2: Test the Effect

Now test that the instructions are actually working. Ask Claude Code:

```
What module should I work on next?
```

Claude Code should check `progress.json` to find your current progress and recommend the next incomplete module. This behaviour is not built into Claude Code itself — it comes from CLAUDE.md telling the agent about the progress tracking system and the `/project:progress` command.

Now try:

```
What is the naming convention for module files?
```

Claude Code should answer with the `X.Y-slug.md` format. Again, this is not general knowledge — it comes directly from CLAUDE.md's conventions section.

## Step 3: Understand the Architecture Section

Ask Claude Code to focus on a specific part:

```
Show me the architecture section of CLAUDE.md and explain how the docs-site/docs/ directory is organised.
```

The architecture section is a map of the project. It tells Claude Code where files live, what they do, and how they connect. Without this section, Claude Code would need to discover the structure by reading files — with it, the agent already knows the layout and can act efficiently.

This is context engineering in action: structured information, provided upfront, that makes every subsequent interaction faster and more accurate.

## Step 4: Create a CLAUDE.md for Your Learning Journal

Now let us create your own. Ask Claude Code:

```
I have a repository called learning-journal on GitHub (we created it in Module 1.2). Help me write a CLAUDE.md for that project. It should explain that it's a daily learning journal, describe the file structure (README.md, goals.md, day-N.md files), and set conventions for how entries should be written.
```

Claude Code will help you draft a CLAUDE.md. It might look something like:

```markdown title="CLAUDE.md"
# Learning Journal

## Purpose
A daily learning journal tracking progress through a curriculum
on GitHub, Claude Code, and context engineering.

## Structure
- `README.md` — project description and overview
- `goals.md` — learning objectives with checkboxes
- `day-N.md` — daily journal entries (N = day number)

## Conventions
- Each day file starts with `# Day N: Topic`
- Include sections: What I Learned, Questions I Have, Key Takeaway
- Use ISO 8601 dates in entries (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Commit messages should describe what was learned, not just "update"
```

You can customise this however you like. The point is that once this file exists in your learning-journal repository, any Claude Code session in that project will automatically know the structure and conventions.

## Step 5: Test Your New CLAUDE.md

If you have the learning-journal cloned locally, navigate to it and create the CLAUDE.md:

```bash
cd path/to/learning-journal
claude
```

Then ask:

```
What is this project and how are the files organised?
```

Claude Code will read your CLAUDE.md and respond with accurate, project-specific information. Without the file, it would have had to guess or explore. With the file, it knows immediately.

Try asking it to create a new day entry:

```
Create a day-2.md entry about what I learned regarding context engineering.
```

It should follow the conventions from your CLAUDE.md — using the heading format, including the right sections, and following the naming pattern.

## What We Built

You accomplished something important:

- **Examined** the CLAUDE.md that has been shaping your learning experience
- **Tested** its effects by asking questions only the context could answer
- **Understood** why each section exists and what it does
- **Created** your own CLAUDE.md for a real project
- **Verified** that it works by starting a session with it

You now understand the most fundamental piece of context engineering: the project instructions file. Every Claude Code project benefits from a well-written CLAUDE.md. It is the single highest-leverage file you can create.

## Knowledge Check

1. When does Claude Code read CLAUDE.md?
   - A) Only when you explicitly ask it to
   - B) Automatically at the start of every session in that project directory
   - C) Only during the first session
   - D) When you run a specific command

2. In your own words, explain why a 20-line CLAUDE.md file can have more impact than a 200-line prompt. What makes it different?

## Next Steps

- [Signal, Noise, and the Attention Budget](./3.3-signal-noise-and-the-attention-budget.md) — learn why less is often more in context engineering
- [The CLAUDE.md Hierarchy](./3.5-the-claudemd-hierarchy.md) — discover the full system of context files beyond the project root
