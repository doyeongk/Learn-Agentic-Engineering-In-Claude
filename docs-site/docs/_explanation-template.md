# Understanding [Topic]

> **Key question**: [The central question this explanation answers]

## Context

[Why does this topic matter? What problem or situation makes it relevant? 2-3 paragraphs providing context and framing the discussion.]

## The Core Idea

[Explain the fundamental concept. Use analogies if helpful. This is the "aha moment" section — build towards understanding, don't just state facts.]

## How It Works

[Deeper dive into mechanics. Use diagrams (Mermaid) if helpful. Multiple paragraphs exploring the topic from different angles.]

## Trade-offs and Alternatives

[Discuss why things are the way they are. What alternatives exist? What are the trade-offs? This is where explanation shines — the "why" behind decisions. Include only when genuine alternatives or trade-offs exist.]

## Common Misconceptions

[OPTIONAL — include only when there are genuinely surprising or non-obvious misconceptions that the reader is likely to hold. Omit if the concept is straightforward or if the misconceptions would be contrived. When included, each entry should correct a belief the reader probably walked in with.]

## Connections

[OPTIONAL — include only when the connections are non-obvious or when the module sits at a junction between concepts. Omit for modules where the relationship to the rest of the curriculum is self-evident.]

## Knowledge Check
