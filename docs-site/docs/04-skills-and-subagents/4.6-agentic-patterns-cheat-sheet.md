# Agentic Patterns Cheat Sheet

> A quick reference for every pattern, tool, and technique covered in this curriculum.

## Overview

This module is your reference card. Bookmark it. Come back to it when you need to decide which tool to use, how to structure a workflow, or how to avoid common mistakes.

## Decision Framework: What Do I Need?

| I need to... | Use | Why |
|--------------|-----|-----|
| Set project-wide instructions | CLAUDE.md | Always loaded, shared with team via Git |
| Set personal preferences | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Applies to all your projects, private |
| Give specialist knowledge for a task | Skill (`.claude/skills/`) | Loaded on demand, keeps base context lean |
| Create a reusable workflow | Command (`.claude/commands/`) | Invokable via `/name` |
| Run independent tasks in parallel | Subagents (Task tool) | Isolated context, concurrent execution |
| Track state across sessions | JSON file (e.g., `progress.json`) | Structured, readable by AI and humans |
| Persist a cross-session decision | CLAUDE.md or auto-memory | Survives session boundaries |

## Orchestration Patterns

### Fan-out (Parallel Research)

Launch multiple subagents to research different topics simultaneously. Combine results in the parent.

```
Parent: "Research X, Y, Z in parallel"
├── Subagent 1: Research X → returns summary
├── Subagent 2: Research Y → returns summary
└── Subagent 3: Research Z → returns summary
Parent: Combines summaries into unified result
```

**When to use**: Independent research tasks, data gathering from multiple sources.
**Example**: The `/init` research phase.

### Chain (Sequential Pipeline)

Each step depends on the previous one. Run sequentially.

```
Step 1: Gather requirements → output
Step 2: Design solution (using Step 1 output)
Step 3: Implement (using Step 2 design)
Step 4: Verify (testing Step 3 output)
```

**When to use**: Tasks with dependencies, build-then-test workflows.
**Example**: Module delivery — read content, load skill, deliver, update progress.

### Skill + Subagent Combo

A subagent loads a skill to do specialist work.

```
Parent: Launch subagent with skill reference
└── Subagent: Reads skill → follows procedures → returns result
```

**When to use**: Specialist tasks that should not pollute the parent's context.
**Example**: A code review subagent that loads the code-reviewer skill.

### Coordinator Pattern

A command file orchestrates multiple skills and subagents.

```
Command file:
1. Load Skill A (formatting)
2. Launch Subagent 1 (data gathering)
3. Launch Subagent 2 (data gathering)
4. Combine results using Skill A's format
5. Update state file
```

**When to use**: Complex workflows with multiple components.
**Example**: The daily-digest command from Module 4.4.

## Skill Anatomy — Quick Reference

```
.claude/skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required. Entry point.
│   ├── Purpose           # What this skill is for
│   ├── Procedure         # Step-by-step instructions
│   ├── Rules             # Constraints and requirements
│   └── Examples          # Concrete illustrations
└── reference/            # Optional. Supporting docs.
    ├── checklist.md
    └── examples.md
```

## Subagent Quick Reference

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Created with | `Task` tool |
| Context | Isolated — own window, no parent history |
| Returns | Condensed summary only |
| Nesting | Not allowed (flat hierarchy) |
| Types | general-purpose, Explore, Bash, Plan |
| Parallel | Yes — multiple can run simultaneously |
| File access | Can read files; write access depends on permissions |

## The CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md         → User-wide (personal)
CLAUDE.md                   → Project-wide (shared via Git)
.claude/CLAUDE.local.md     → Project-local (personal, gitignored)
.claude/auto-memory.md      → Auto-generated learnings
```

Narrower scope wins in conflicts. Project overrides user. Local overrides project.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Putting everything in CLAUDE.md | Dilutes attention budget, slow context loading | Move specialist knowledge to skills |
| Running one long session for everything | Context rot degrades quality | Fresh sessions for unrelated tasks |
| Not using structured state files | AI parses prose inconsistently | Use JSON for state, markdown for instructions |
| Writing vague subagent prompts | Subagent lacks context, returns poor results | Be specific: what to do, what files to read, what format to return |
| Skipping the verification step | Errors compound silently | Always verify: run tests, check output, read results |
| Duplicating context across files | Conflicting instructions, wasted attention | Single source of truth for each piece of information |

## Extension Spectrum

Claude Code can be extended at multiple levels, from lightweight to heavyweight:

| Level | Mechanism | Complexity | Persistence |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Conversation | Tell Claude Code what to do in chat | None | Session only |
| CLAUDE.md | Write project instructions | Low | Cross-session |
| Skills | Create specialist knowledge files | Medium | Cross-session |
| Commands | Create reusable slash commands | Medium | Cross-session |
| Subagents | Orchestrate parallel isolated workers | High | Per-invocation |
| Hooks | Shell commands triggered by events | High | Cross-session |
| MCP servers | External tool servers | Highest | Persistent service |

Start at the top. Only move down when the lighter option is insufficient.

## Knowledge Check

1. You need to run three independent research tasks as fast as possible. Which pattern should you use?
   - A) Chain (sequential pipeline)
   - B) Put everything in CLAUDE.md
   - C) Skill + Subagent combo
   - D) Fan-out (parallel research)

2. You notice Claude Code is ignoring instructions from your CLAUDE.md during a long session. What is the most likely cause and fix?
   - A) The file was deleted — recreate it
   - B) Permission mode is wrong — change it
   - C) The model is broken — wait and try later
   - D) Context rot — start a fresh session
