# Tutorial: Creating Your First Skill

> **What you will build**: A "code-reviewer" skill that gives Claude Code a specific procedure and checklist for reviewing code.
>
> **Prerequisites**: Understanding of skills from [Module 4.1](./4.1-what-are-skills.md). Claude Code installed.
>
> **Time**: ~25 minutes

## Introduction

We are going to build a skill from scratch. The skill will teach Claude Code how to perform a code review — examining code for common issues, following a structured checklist, and providing feedback in a specific format.

Along the way, we will see the difference between Claude Code *without* the skill (generic, improvised) and *with* the skill (structured, consistent). This contrast makes the value of skills tangible.

## Step 1: See Claude Code Without the Skill

Before building the skill, let us see how Claude Code handles a code review request on its own. Start Claude Code in this project:

```bash
claude
```

Ask it to review a piece of code:

```
Review this Python code and give me feedback:

def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total = total + item['price'] * item['qty']
    return total
```

Claude Code will give you feedback — probably reasonable, but generic. It might mention variable naming, error handling, or type hints. The response will be improvised, with no consistent structure.

Note the format and content of the feedback. We will compare this later.

## Step 2: Create the Skill Directory

Ask Claude Code to create the skill structure:

```
Create a directory at .claude/skills/code-reviewer/ and create a SKILL.md file inside it.
```

Approve the file creation when prompted.

## Step 3: Write the SKILL.md

Now let us fill in the skill. Ask Claude Code:

```
Write the following content into .claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md:
```

Then provide this content (or type it directly):

```markdown title=".claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md"
# Code Reviewer Skill

Provides structured code review following a consistent checklist
and output format. Use this skill when asked to review code.

## Procedure

1. Read the code completely before commenting
2. Run through the checklist (see reference/checklist.md)
3. Categorise each finding as: BUG, STYLE, PERFORMANCE, or SUGGESTION
4. Present findings in this format:

### Review Summary
- Total findings: [number]
- Critical (bugs): [number]
- Non-critical: [number]

### Findings

**[CATEGORY] Line N: Brief title**
Description of the issue and why it matters.
Suggested fix (if applicable).

## Rules

- Never review without running the full checklist
- Always categorise findings — no uncategorised comments
- Lead with bugs, then performance, then style, then suggestions
- If the code is good, say so explicitly — do not invent issues
- Keep feedback actionable — every finding should have a clear fix or recommendation
```

## Step 4: Add a Reference Checklist

Create a reference file with the review checklist:

```
Create a directory .claude/skills/code-reviewer/reference/ and add a file called checklist.md inside it.
```

Write this content:

```markdown title=".claude/skills/code-reviewer/reference/checklist.md"
# Code Review Checklist

Run through each category in order. Mark items as checked.

## Correctness
- [ ] Does the code do what it claims to do?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled (empty input, null values, zero)?
- [ ] Are there off-by-one errors in loops or indices?

## Error Handling
- [ ] Are exceptions caught appropriately?
- [ ] Are error messages helpful and specific?
- [ ] Does it fail gracefully or crash?

## Performance
- [ ] Are there unnecessary loops or repeated calculations?
- [ ] Could any operations be simplified?
- [ ] Are there potential memory issues with large inputs?

## Readability
- [ ] Are variable names descriptive and consistent?
- [ ] Is the code structured logically?
- [ ] Would a new team member understand this without explanation?

## Security (if applicable)
- [ ] Is user input validated?
- [ ] Are there injection risks?
- [ ] Is sensitive data handled carefully?
```

## Step 5: Test With the Skill

Now let us see the difference. In the same Claude Code session, ask it to load the skill and review the same code:

```
Read the skill at .claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md and the checklist at .claude/skills/code-reviewer/reference/checklist.md. Then review this code using the skill's procedure:

def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total = total + item['price'] * item['qty']
    return total
```

Compare this response to Step 1. The review should now:

- Follow the structured format (Summary + Findings)
- Categorise each finding (BUG, STYLE, PERFORMANCE, SUGGESTION)
- Run through the checklist systematically
- Be consistent and reproducible

This is the power of skills. The same Claude Code, the same code to review, but a dramatically different (and more useful) output because of the specialist knowledge in the context.

## Step 6: Iterate on the Skill

Skills improve over time. If you noticed anything missing from the review — perhaps you want it to always suggest test cases, or always comment on documentation — update the SKILL.md:

```
Add a rule to .claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md: "Always end with a 'Suggested Tests' section listing 2-3 test cases that would verify the code's correctness."
```

Run the review again to see the updated behaviour. This iterative refinement is how skills evolve — you notice gaps, update the skill, and test.

## What We Built

You created a complete skill from scratch:

- **SKILL.md** — the entry point with procedures, format, and rules
- **reference/checklist.md** — a supporting document with the detailed review checklist
- **Tested the difference** — saw how the same task produces better results with a skill loaded
- **Iterated** — refined the skill based on observed results

This is the pattern for any skill you want to build: define the task, write the procedure, add reference material, test, and refine.

## Knowledge Check

1. What is the minimum file needed to create a skill?
   - A) A SKILL.md file in .claude/skills/
   - B) A SKILL.md file plus at least one reference file
   - C) A CLAUDE.md entry plus a SKILL.md file
   - D) A command file that references the skill

2. In your own words, explain why the second review (with the skill) was more useful than the first. What specifically changed?

## Next Steps

- [Subagents: Isolated Workers](./4.3-subagents-isolated-workers.md) — learn about another way to provide specialist context
- [Orchestrating Parallel Work](./4.4-orchestrating-parallel-work.md) — combine skills with subagents for powerful workflows
