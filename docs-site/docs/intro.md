# Learn Claude in Claude

A curriculum that teaches you agentic engineering — from the very basics of GitHub to orchestrating AI agents with skills and subagents — all inside a system built using the exact techniques it teaches you.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this curriculum, you'll be able to:

- **Understand GitHub** — what version control is, why it exists, and how to use repos, branches, and pull requests
- **Use Claude Code** — not as a chatbot, but as an autonomous agent that reads files, edits code, and runs commands on your computer
- **Engineer context** — write CLAUDE.md files that shape Claude's behaviour, manage the attention budget, and keep sessions effective
- **Build skills and subagents** — create reusable knowledge packs and orchestrate parallel AI workers to tackle complex tasks

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up and begin:

1. **Go to GitHub** — navigate to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account if you don't already have one
2. **Clone this repository** — copy the repo to your local machine using the green "Code" button on the repo page, or run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/doyeongk/Learn-Agentic-Engineering-In-Claude.git
   ```
3. **Open the folder in Claude** — pick whichever interface suits you:
   - **Claude Code** (terminal) — `cd Learn-Agentic-Engineering-In-Claude` and launch Claude Code
   - **Claude Desktop App** (Code mode) — open the cloned folder as a project
   - **Cowork** — open the cloned folder in a Cowork session
4. **Tell Claude to start** — once the project is loaded:
   - In **Claude Code**: run `/project:start`
   - In **Claude Desktop App** or **Cowork**: send `@start.md`

That's it. Claude will guide you through each module interactively, checking your understanding as you go. Your progress is tracked automatically.

> If any of this is confusing, copy-paste this whole page into [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and ask it to explain.

### Other useful commands

- `/project:progress` — see how far you've been
- `/project:review` — spaced repetition for completed modules
- `/project:help` — full command reference

### Reading on this site

You can also browse the sidebar to read any module directly. The curriculum is structured in four sections, meant to be followed in order:

1. **[Why GitHub Exists](./01-why-github-exists/1.1-the-problem-github-solves.md)** — version control fundamentals
2. **[Meet Claude Code](./02-meet-claude-code/2.1-from-chat-to-agent.md)** — the agent paradigm
3. **[Context Engineering](./03-context-engineering/3.1-what-is-context.md)** — managing what Claude sees
4. **[Skills & Subagents](./04-skills-and-subagents/4.1-what-are-skills.md)** — extending and orchestrating Claude

## The meta angle

Here's the thing: this project is built using every concept it teaches. The CLAUDE.md shaping your sessions? That's context engineering. The skills delivering your lessons? Those are real skills. The subagents that researched your curriculum? Those were real subagents running in parallel.

You'll discover this layer by layer — and by the final module, you'll trace the full architecture from end to end.

## Start here

**[Module 1.1: The Problem GitHub Solves](./01-why-github-exists/1.1-the-problem-github-solves.md)** — begin with why version control matters.
